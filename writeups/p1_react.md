# React

React is a JavaScript library used to create dynamic and responsive single page applications. It was created by Jordan Walke and 
initially released in 2013. Today, it is listed as the most used web framework among developers. React abstracts a lot of the 
complex coding that was originally needed to create dynamic web pages which is what makes it a powerfull and popular library.

**Strengths**:
- Easy to learn: React is an open source library which means there are numerous tutorials and how-to videos on using the framework.
  JavaScript is also an extremely popular language among developers and anyone with a bakground in the language can pickup React 
  fairly quickly.
- Reusability: React is based on building reusable components to create a webpage. This enables developers to create basic building
  block components that can then be reused as needed.
- Mobile Design: A version of React known as React Native can be used to build cross platform mobile applications. Once a developer knows React
  they can use the same skills for mobile development.
-Efficiency: React uses a virtual DOM which means it only re-renders components that require re-evaluation. This feautre impromves the ovearall
 performance of the webpage.
