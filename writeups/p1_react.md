# React

React is a JavaScript library used to create dynamic and responsive single page applications. It was created by Jordan Walke and 
initially released in 2013. Today, it is listed as the most used web framework among developers. React abstracts a lot of the 
complex coding that was originally needed to create dynamic web pages which is what makes it a powerfull and popular library.

**Strengths**:
- Easy to learn: React is an open source library which means there are numerous tutorials and how-to videos on using the framework.
  JavaScript is also an extremely popular language among developers and anyone with a bakground in the language can pickup React 
  fairly quickly.
- Reusability: React is based on building reusable components to create a webpage. This enables developers to create basic building
  block components that can then be reused as needed.
- Mobile Design: A version of React known as React Native can be used to build cross platform mobile applications. Once a developer knows React
  they can use the same skills for mobile development.
-Efficiency: React uses a virtual DOM which means it only re-renders components that require re-evaluation. This feautre improves the ovearall
 performance of the webpage.
 
 
**Weaknesses**:
- JSX: While the React library and concepts are fairly easy to learn , the JSX syntax can take some time     to grasp. JSX stands for JavaScriptHTML and is what enables             developers to write HTML alongside JavaScript
-  Pace of development: This can be seen as both a pro and a con. The react library is constantly growing
  at a rapid pace and this allows developers to use new and evolving technologies. However, due to the this rapid growth, the documentation for certain things can be lacking
