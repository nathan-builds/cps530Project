          Overall the experience of using Flask and React went fairly well.
          Flask was easy to install and configure making it optimal for a small
          project such as this. Being able to easily define REST endpoints
          within the Flask architecture allowed us to quickly link our React
          frontend with our backend. Using the npm package manager made
          installing and creating the React frontend very simple; this process
          took about five minutes. Configuring links to each of the different
          pages took a little more work due to the fact that React apps use the
          Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The learning curve to
          learn both Flask and React wasn't too steep, as what was required to
          get a working website up and running wasn't too complex and, instead,
          quite straightforward. The code we wrote felt like an extension to
          what we did when we learned HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP, and that there
          was a lot more abstraction and various (straightforward) concepts to
          (1) make it easier to create a website, and (2) to be able to do more
          powerful things. 
          </p>

          We would not do things differently in retrospect, as
          we're quite happy with how our end product turned out. However, if we
          were to go back to this project, and assuming we had more time, we'd
          definitely make this project more feature filled as it has quite a bit
          of potential.
          </p>
          
          <p>
           Flask and React are both great frameworks, and
          definitely solid choices we'd choose for future projects. Thus, we
          have no regrets in the frameworks we chose, and mostly have positive
          things to say about them.
